# Unity Cloud Build To HockeyApp

A NodeJS application to automate binary deployments from Unity Cloud Build to HockeyApp.

![Slack Screenshot](screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot of Unity Cloud Build and HockeyApp activity within Slack when using this application.")

Note; This is an initial release which is functional, but needs refactoring.

## App Flow

  1. Receive a webhook from Unity Cloud Build to notify a build is ready. 
  2. Get the build details from the JSON payload within the webhook.
  3. Download the app binary from the Unity Cloud Build API.
  4. Upload the app binary to HockeyApp.

## Requirements

- Setup a [Unity Cloud Build](https://unity3d.com/services/cloud-build) account and project.
- Setup a [HockeyApp](https://hockeyapp.net/) account. HockeyApp will use the app package name to detemine which project to upload to.

## Installation

  1. Clone this repository.

  2. Add API keys to '.env' for both Unity Cloud Build and HockeyApp.
    * UCB API key can be obtained [here](https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/preferences/).
    * HockeyApp API key can be created [here](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/manage/auth_tokens). Be sure to create a key 'Upload' rights (e.g. anything above 'Read Only').

  3. Deploy.  
    * Have only tested running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
  4. Setup the Unity Cloud Build webhook.
    * Within UCB, view your app. Click 'Notifications', then 'Add New' and enter your app URL with '/build' appended. E.g. 'http://[appurl]/build/'
    * Use a tool like [Request Bin](https://requestb.in/) to test web hooks from UCB, ontain the payload and test requests to '/build/'.

## Notes

- If you use Slack, integrate UCB and HockeyApp to be notified when a new build is ready and has been pused to HockeyApp. See screenshot above.
- You don't need to setup the app on HockeyApp, if you upload the binary it will automatically create a new app instance.
- Configure HockeyApp to automatically notify users after the binary has uploaded. See the 'notify' variable within the 'uploadToHockeyApp()' function. [HockeyApp API](https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/api/api-versions#upload-version)

## Todo
  - Clean up and comment codebase.
  - Populate HockeyApp release notes with Git commit message.
  - Add logging feature to show builds processed and deployed.
  - Integrate job system to manage/prioritise jobs and view jobs in progress.
